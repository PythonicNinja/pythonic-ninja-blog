# Problem 😱

You have some program running on react-native default port.

# Solution 🤓

You will need to run packager with following port:

```bash
yarn start --port 8085
```

In your xcode open `project_dir/ios/project.xcodeproj`.
Change following line `Libraries/React.xcode.proj/React/Base RCTBundleURLProvider.m` 
```bash
const NSUInteger kRCTBundleURLProviderDefaultPort = 8085;
```
